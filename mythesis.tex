\begin{abstract} 
    RNTuple is the new data storage format set to replace TTree at the start of the High Luminosity LHC. An investigation was conducted on how analysis workflows for ATLAS researchers will change with RNTuple. Additionally, performance studies have been conducted that demonstrate an improvement in speed and memory usage at the analysis front. Finally, different compression algorithms were tested and it was found that blah blah remains to best work with RNTuple.
